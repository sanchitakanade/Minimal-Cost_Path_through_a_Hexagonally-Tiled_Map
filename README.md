## Project Description

1. This project implements Dijkstra Algorithm on a HexagonMap having 233 nodes, shown in a file HexagonMap.pdf
2. It takes text file as input and convert all data into a graph like the diagram in a file HexagonMap.pdf
3. after that it finds a minimal-cost path from a source node 226 to a destination node 8
4. and displays the minimal-cost path and a minimum cost in a file MinimumCostPath.txt.
5. Program also displays time required to calculate minimal-cost path in ms.
	 
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

 To run this program user required to have any Java IDE and git (Distributed Version Control System).

### Installation
I am using eclipse, java IDE and a web based git platform 'github.com'
1. Go to the following website
   https://ninite.com/
2. Select proper JDK and eclipse, then click on 'Get your Ninite'. 
3. Download and install eclipse and JDK.
4. Go to https://github.com/ and create an account.
5. Open a git perspective in the eclipse on your computer
6. Clone this repository into eclipse IDE using option 'Clone a Git Repository and add a clone to this view'.
7. Switch over to java perspective -> right click -> select import -> select 'Projects from Git' -> next
8. select 'Existing local repository' -> next -> JavaProjects -> next
9. select 'Import using the New Project wizard' -> click on 'Finish'
10. Java Project -> next -> Give project name -> Bowse the location of JavaProjects repository on your local machine 
instead of using default location -> Finish.
11. Run the project
